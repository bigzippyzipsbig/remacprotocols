###PROTOCOL 1
INTRODUCTION
- The Regional Unified Protocols of New York City include the statewide Basic Life Support Adult and Pediatric Treatment Protocols as the current minimal standards for basic life support (BLS) delivered by Certified First Responders (CFR), and Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) in New York State.
Paramedic (advanced life support [ALS]) protocols have been included in the unified format to ensure a continuous transition of care from CFR through ALS
- Each level provider shall start from the beginning of any given protocol and complete the treatments in the order listed while using good clinical judgment. The order of treatments may require modification based on the patient’s clinical condition. When there are multiple providers, some treatments may be administered simultaneously
- Standing orders for each provider level follows a colored header with a STOP indicating the end of the respective treatments and procedures for that provider level
- Definitions of each section are described below
CFR and All Provider Levels
1. Standing order treatments start in this section and applies to CFRs and all provider levels
CFR STOP

- Maximum joule setting may vary depending on the defibrillator used
- Consider the possibility of conditions with reversible causes masquerading as PEA/asystole that require immediate treatment
- Routine use of Calcium Chloride and/or Sodium Bicarbonate in cardiac arrest has not been shown to improve outcomes
- Calcium Chloride and Sodium Bicarbonate should be given in separate IV lines or separated by a flush of at least 20 ml of crystalloid fluid to prevent precipitation
- As per AHA, the benefit of double sequential defibrillation for refractory shockable rhythms has not been established

    - OPTION B: Magnesium Sulfate 25-50 mg/kg IV (maximum 2 g)
Key Points / Considerations
- Defibrillation should not be delayed or withheld for any reason
- If the cardiac monitor is unable to deliver the desired weight-based joule setting, use the closest setting without exceeding the desired setting
- Do not interrupt chest compressions for placement of an advanced airway
- Effective bag valve mask ventilation is a reasonable alternative to advanced airway interventions (endotracheal intubation or use of a supraglottic airway) in the management of pediatric cardiac arrests in the out-of-hospital setting
- Utilize a PEEP valve, if available, when performing assisted ventilations
- 10% Dextrose is strongly preferred for patients with age ≤ 1 month; 5% Dextrose may be used if 10% Dextrose is unavailable. For patients with age between 1 month – 14 years, 5% Dextrose, 10% Dextrose or 25% Dextrose may be used
- Magnesium Sulfate must be diluted prior to administration. An example method uses Magnesium Sulfate 2 g diluted in 50 ml Normal Saline (final concentration 40 mg/ml). Agitate the solution prior to withdrawing the desired volume
- If the provider is uncertain whether a patient should be treated under adult or pediatric cardiac arrest protocols, begin CPR and consult OLMC
###ENDPROTOCOL

Medical Control Options

Key Points / Considerations
- Respiratory distress is characterized by increased respiratory effort (work of breathing) WITHOUT central cyanosis, including anxiety, nasal flaring, elevated respiratory rate, use of accessory muscles of respiration (e.g. retractions)
- Respiratory failure is characterized by:
  - Ineffective respiratory effort and symptoms of respiratory distress WITH central cyanosis, including agitation, lethargy, severe dyspnea, labored breathing, head bobbing, grunting, or significant suprasternal, substernal, intercostal and/or parasternal retractions, bradypnea leading to ineffective oxygenation or ventilation
  - Presence of hypoxia and/or hypercapnia
- Monitor breathing continuously and assess for signs of hypoxia and/or increasing respiratory distress
- Bradycardia is an ominous sign that indicates hypoxic cardiac arrest may be imminent
- High concentration oxygen should always be used in pediatric patients
- Do not allow the mask to press against the eyes
- Chest rise is the best indication of adequate ventilation in pediatric patients
- Do not overinflate the lungs when assisting ventilations
- Do not hyperextend the neck
- Blow-by oxygen is an inadequate method of oxygenation. Use the closest age or size- appropriate oxygen delivery mechanism (e.g. nasal cannula, facemask, bag valve mask)
- Effective bag valve mask ventilation is a reasonable alternative to advanced airway interventions (endotracheal intubation or use of a supraglottic airway) in the management of pediatric patients with severe respiratory distress or respiratory failure
- Utilize a PEEP valve, if available, when performing assisted ventilations
- For the tachypneic child with abnormal respirations, consider a glucose check to evaluate for hyperglycemia
- Tension pneumothorax in a pediatric patient in respiratory arrest may develop after resuscitative efforts have begun

Key Points / Considerations
- Chemical restraint is defined as the administration of a sedative or dissociative medication to prevent injury
- Chemical restraint is intended for patients who are suffering from Hyperactive Delirium. This is a syndrome that includes psychomotor agitation (aggression, reduced sensitivity to pain, violent struggling), physiologic excitation (tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis), and delirium
- Medication for chemical restraint shall NOT be administered as a standing order if the patient is either:
  - Agitated or non-compliant with requests or directions, but does not require physical restraint
  - Physically restrained and not struggling against the restraints
- The preferred route for standing order Midazolam administration is intramuscular due to the speed of administration. Intravenous administration should only be done if IV access has already been established
- Agitated patients should be presumed to have an underlying medical or traumatic condition
- Refer to heat emergencies protocol for concern of hyperthermia
- All suicidal or violent threats or gestures must be taken seriously
- Diabetic patients with a blood glucose level reading between 60-80 mg/dl may still be symptomatic secondary to hypoglycemia. In the presence of such signs and symptoms, treat accordingly

- Patients must NOT be transported in a prone (face-down) position
- If the patient is in police custody and/or has handcuffs on, a police officer must accompany the patient in the patient compartment of the ambulance to the hospital. The provider must have the ability to immediately remove any mechanical restraints that may hinder patient care at all times
- It is preferrable for patients to have their handcuffs secured to the stretcher and NOT be handcuffed behind their back when on a stretcher
- EMS providers are responsible for determining the need for chemical restraint. EMS providers may not be ordered to administer chemical restraint by law enforcement. Contact OLMC if there are any questions about the appropriateness of chemical restraint

- Unstable Dysrhythmia:
  - ADULT: Patients with a dysrhythmia associated with ANY of the following:
    - Hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg or MAP < 65 mmHg)
    - Altered mental status
- Consider procedural sedation prior to any electrical therapy for conscious patients
- When using a monitor for which the maximum joule setting is less than 360 joules, utilize biphasic equivalent synchronized energy settings
- Further repeated attempts at synchronized cardioversion should be performed using the monitor’s maximum setting if the device cannot deliver more than 200 joules in place of the consecutive joule settings listed in the protocols
- Diltiazem should be used with caution in patients with liver or kidney disease, congestive heart failure, atrioventricular conduction abnormalities, and/or hypotension. OLMC should be alerted to these conditions, and the dose should be reduced to half the predicted weight-based dose
- Calcium Chloride and Sodium Bicarbonate should be given in separate IV lines or separated by a flush of at least 20 ml of crystalloid fluid
- Treat any unstable dysrhythmia prior to the initiation of a 12-lead EKG
- Intravascular access may be delayed if necessary to allow for emergent synchronized cardioversion of an unstable dysrhythmia.

3. If the patient is in active labor, visually inspect the vagina for bulging or crowning
4. If delivery is imminent, proceed as follows:
4.1. Apply gentle pressure against the delivering newborn’s head to prevent tearing of the perineum
    - DO NOT apply pressure to the soft spots (fontanels)
    - Support the bony parts of the head as it presents
4.2. As the head presents, gently clear the airway of secretions using the bulb syringe as follows:
    - Depress the bulb syringe prior to insertion
    - Suction the mouth first by inserting the syringe no more than 1.5 inches into the newborn’s mouth
    - Suction the nose by inserting the syringe no more than 0.5 inches into the newborn’s nose
4.3. Nuchal Cord
    - If the umbilical cord is loose enough, gently slip it over the newborn’s head immediately
    - If the umbilical cord is wrapped tightly around the neck such that it prevents manipulation, place two clamps on the cord and cut between the clamps
4.4. Support the head and chest as the newborn delivers
4.5. Repeat suctioning as necessary prior to spontaneous or stimulated respirations
4.6. Gently guide the head downward until the shoulder appears. Deliver the other shoulder with gentle upward traction
4.7. Thoroughly but rapidly dry the newborn with a clean, dry towel
5. Delay clamping of the umbilical cord for up to one (1) minute after uncomplicated delivery, if safe to do so. Cut the umbilical cord by performing the following:
5.1. Place the first clamp 8-10 inches from the newborn
5.2. Place the second clamp 3 inches from the first clamp toward the mother
5.3. Cut between the clamps and check both ends for bleeding. If continuous bleeding is seen from either end of the cord, add a second clamp to the bleeding end
5.4. If umbilical clamps are not available, tie the umbilical cord with gauze at the same landmarks, but DO NOT cut the cord

6. Wrap the newborn in a dry, warm blanket/towel with a layer of foil or plastic wrap over the blanket/towel, or use a commercial infant swaddler, if available. Do not use foil alone
7. Cover the newborn’s scalp with a warm covering

14. If miscarriage or stillbirth occurs, bring all fetal material to the hospital with the mother. If the viability of the fetus is uncertain, begin neonatal resuscitation
15. Special Considerations:
15.1. Breech Presentation
    - Place the mother in a face-up position with hips elevated
    - Support the newborn’s thorax during delivery
    - Be prepared as a full delivery may occur
    - If the head does not deliver immediately:
      - Place sterile, gloved fingers between the newborn’s face and the wall of the birth canal to establish an air passageway. This position must be maintained until the head delivers
      - Fetal body should be supported at or below the angle of the birth canal. Presenting parts should not be raised upward
      - Do not apply traction while the newborn is in the birth canal
15.2. Prolapsed Cord
    - Place the mother in a knee to chest position
    - Encourage the mother not to push
    - If the cord is not pulsating, place sterile, gloved fingers into the birth canal and push the head back 1-2 inches towards the cervix until the cord begins to pulsate
    - Wrap saline-moistened, sterile dressings around the cord
    - Do not attempt to insert the cord back into the birth canal
    - The cord should be continuously monitored for the presence of a pulse

    - This position will most likely need to be maintained during transport to allow for umbilical blood circulation
15.3. Intact (not ruptured) Amniotic Sac
    - Immediately remove the sac from around the face using sterile, gloved fingers only
15.4. Shoulder Dystocia (wedged shoulders)
    - Encourage the mother not to push
    - Place the mother in a knee to chest position. This may require having providers assist the mother to maintain a hyperflexed position of the legs (McRoberts maneuver)
    - Place the mother in Trendelenburg position or place the head of the bed lower than the legs
    - Apply firm, steady suprapubic pressure. Avoid fundal pressure as this will worsen the condition
    - If these maneuvers fail to deliver the newborn, reposition the mother on her hands and knees
    - Guide the head downward to aid in the delivery of the upper shoulder
15.5. Multiple Births
    - Deliver each birth accordingly, making sure to tie each umbilical cord between births
    - Clamp and cut the cord of the first newborn prior to the next birth
    - If the second birth does not occur within 10 minutes, begin transport

Key Points / Considerations
- Cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a neonate is performed with chest compressions and ventilations in a 3:1 ratio at a rate of 120 per minute (90 compressions, 30 ventilations)
- Spontaneous respirations should begin within 30 seconds after birth
- Reposition the airway if unable to ventilate the neonate
- Each ventilation should be administered gently over one second per respiratory cycle, ensuring that the chest rises with each ventilation
- Neonates are subject to rapid heat loss and must be kept warm and dry
- Do not delay transport or resuscitation in order to obtain an APGAR Score
- The proximal tibia is the only site acceptable for intraosseous access in the neonate
- Heart rate in neonates is best assessed at the abdomen or the umbilical stump
- Acrocyanosis (cyanosis of the hands and feet) is a common finding in neonate. If this is present, ensure that the neonate is warm and dry

  - OPTION B: Lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV/IN/IM (maximum 2 mg)
  - OPTION C: Diazepam 0.2 mg/kg IV/IN/IM (maximum 5 mg)
Key Points / Considerations
- Paramedics should not administer the CFR or EMT dosage of Naloxone, and should start with the titration listed in the Paramedic section
  - It is safest to use the lowest dose of Naloxone that reverses the respiratory depression of an opioid overdose patient. This lowers the risk of precipitating opioid withdrawal and pulmonary edema. If Paramedics are on scene, the higher doses listed in the CFR and EMT sections should be withheld in favor of the titration of smaller increments as listed in the Paramedic section

Medical Control Options
14. If the patient continues to actively seize, administer an additional dose of any standing order medication

Key Points / Considerations
- Status epilepticus (prolonged or repetitive seizures) is a critical medical emergency.
Anticonvulsant medication should be administered as soon as possible, preferably starting no later than 5 minutes after the onset of the seizure
- Intravascular access is the preferred route for benzodiazepine administration if it has already been established. If intravascular access has not been established, utilize the most appropriate and quickest route of administration available, with the intranasal (IN) route preferred over the intramuscular (IM) route
- The order of preference of medications when treating seizures is determined by a quick onset of action. Because of its fastest onset of action, Midazolam is the preferred medication; followed by Lorazepam and then Diazepam
- For patients who continue to seize despite benzodiazepine administration, it is preferential to continue additional dosing of the same benzodiazepine, rather than switching to a different medication
- Diabetic patients with a blood glucose level reading between 60-80 mg/dl may still be symptomatic secondary to hypoglycemia. In the presence of such signs and symptoms, treat accordingly
- Consider eclampsia as a cause of seizures for pregnant patients in their third trimester or who have delivered within one month and treat as needed
- When using any of the above medications, monitor the patient using non-invasive capnography, if available
- Do not administer medications for seizures that have stopped

9. For an ADULT patient who does not meet the criteria for standing order sedation for advanced airway management, administer medication options for induction and/or sedation with an advanced airway in place according to the dosing options as listed above

10.For a PEDIATRIC patient requiring procedural sedation, sedation for advanced airway management, including induction and/or sedation with an advanced airway in place, administer medication options according to the weight-based dosing for adult patients
Key Points / Considerations
- Due to its short duration of action, consider using Etomidate as a single sedative agent only for short-term procedures such as synchronized cardioversion
- Consider contacting OLMC for analgesia when performing potentially painful procedures such as transcutaneous pacing or synchronized cardioversion
- Medications may be administered to a patient to maintain an advanced airway, even if an induction agent was not used to place the airway
- If a difficult intubation is anticipated, and the patient can be effectively ventilated, consider managing the patient’s airway without performing advanced airway management
- Peri-intubation hypotension may lead to patient decompensation and/or cardiac arrest. Attempt to improve blood pressure via crystalloid fluid infusion and/or vasopressors prior to intubation

{} FDNY OMA Response Physician Medical Control Options
7. Administer additional dosing of any standing order medication
Key Points / Considerations
- Symptoms for nerve agent exposure are described using the acronym SLUDGEM:
  - Salivation
  - Lacrimation
  - Urination
  - Defecation/diarrhea
  - Gastrointestinal upset
  - Emesis
  - Miosis/muscle twitching
- Any discretionary orders or medical control options MUST be approved by the FDNY OMA Response Physician
- The goal of treatment for patients is the drying of secretions and resolution of other symptoms
- Diazepam is the medication of choice when treating a patient with seizures secondary to nerve agent exposure
- Do not administer more than 3 NAAK units to any patient
- Asymptomatic patients do not require treatment
- Record the number and/or amount of Atropine, NAAK, and benzodiazepines administered on the patient’s triage tag
- Victims whose skin or clothing is contaminated with liquid nerve agent can contaminate rescuers by direct contact or through off-gassing vapor
- Victims who have ingested nerve agents may off-gas dangerous levels of vapor, including from vomit if ingested, even after skin decontamination
